	<p>So, camp's over, but you want to try your stuff at home?</p>
	<p>First, you'll need to download the JDK (Java Development Kit). Go to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u4-downloads-1591156.html">this page</a> and choose the version for your operating system. (Hint: If you have a modern Windows PC, you probably want the last one, Windows x64). Once your JDK download has completed, open the file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.</p>
	<p>Next, download Eclipse. Go to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-372/indigosr2">this page</a> and choose the version for your operating system. Extract the .zip file to a folder on your computer (I recommend C:\Eclipse) and run eclipse.exe. You'll probably want to make a shortcut to it on your desktop or start menu so you can access it easily.</p>
