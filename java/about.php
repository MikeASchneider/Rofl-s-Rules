	<p>I'm "Rofl", a fourth-year Information Technology student at Rochester Institute of Technology, and I love nothing more than sharing my passion for technology with others. I created this site because I felt that there aren't enough online resources available that explain Java programming in a way young people can relate to and understand. I wrote these tutorials with a few guiding principles in mind.:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Empathy. I went through the same struggles learning programming that my students went through. If I can't teach in a way that I wouldn't be able to understand, how can I expect my students to?</li>
		<li>Example. I try to provide a very brief explanation of each topic first, but then I jump right into a code example. Theory can be interesting, but if students can't see a practical example of what we're working toward, our time is wasted.</li>
		<li>Accuracy. I understand Java quite well, but even so I fact-check myself with Oracle's official Java documentation as frequently as possible.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you feel I've violated any of these principles in any way - whether it's as big as "I didn't understand this explanation" or as small as a spelling or grammar mistake - <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/roflsrules.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGdUN2xhalVrd29kdmRlcVhJUXFwRFE6MQ">Please let me know by filling out this form.</a></p>
