 			<p>Hi! Welcome to Rofl's programming class. By the end of the week, you'll have a working project written in the Java programming language. Campers usually create games, homework helpers, or other tools that they find useful.</p>
			<p>Let's start with a quick discussion of the basics. Don't worry, we'll start writing some code real soon.</p>
			<h3>What is programming?</h3>
			<p>Programming is making a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do. When you program a computer, it does exactly what you tell it to do, in exactly the order you tell it. If you ever ask me the question "Why doesn't my program doing this?" my answer will always be "Because you told it to, silly!"</p>
			<p>So now that we've gotten that ultra-simple definition of "programming" out of the way...</p>
			<h3>What is Java?</h3>
			<p>Java is a programming language first created by a company called Sun Microsystems. The first release came out in 1995. Here are some examples of software written in Java that you may know of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Every Android app</li>
				<li>Many popular websites use Java in some form on the server:
					<ul>
						<li>Twitter</li>
						<li>LinkedIn</li>
						<li>Last.fm</li>
						<li>Facebook</li>
						<li>Ebay</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			<p>One of the really cool things about Java is that it runs pretty much everywhere. The programs you write this week will work in Windows, Mac, and even Linux. Java also works inside the browser as small applications called <em>applets</em> (Note: don't confuse Java applets with websites that use JavaScript, which is completely different and very confusingly named). Java is also used for mobile phone applications, as a backend for some websites, and it's used a lot internally by big companies.</p>
			<h3>Punctuation</h3>
			<p>Programming languages, including Java, use lots of punctuation. This may seem obvious to some of you, but it's very important that we not confuse each other by calling the punctuation marks different things, so let's make sure we're all on the same page:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>{ }: "Braces", sometimes also called "curly braces" or "curly brackets"</li>
				<li>[ ]: "Brackets", sometimes also called "square brackets"</li>
				<li>( ): "Parentheses"</li>
				<li>: "Colon"</li>
				<li>;: "Semicolon"</li>
				<li>.: "Dot"</li>
				<li>": "Quotes", also "double quotes"</li>
				<li>': "Single quotes"</li>
			</ul>
